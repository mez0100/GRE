# GRE Prep Plan
1. Set Date to Give GRE
2. Purchase Magoosh and Collect Data
3. Start with Magoosh and Manhattan Books
4. I have 5 Months to give GRE(September 21 - Feb 21)

<h2>5 Month GRE Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li> <h3>Phase 1: (Weeks 1-4)</h3>
<h3>Topic review, video lessons, vocab flashcards, general notes.</h3>
<ul>- ETS Official Guide section overviews (2nd/3rd editions chapters 2, 3, and 5). This content largely overlaps with the Prepare for the Test content on the ETS website.
</ul>
<ul>- Magoosh video lessons. I watched every video for both quantitative and verbal following the 1-month study plan and took notes about key points and strategies that I didn't immediately remember. 
</ul>
<ul>- General notes. Take copious notes about less-familiar topics and strategies while watching the Magoosh videos. At the start of each evening practice session, glance through old notes to refamiliarize with the key points.
</ul>
<ul>- Magoosh practice problems.
</ul>
<ul>- Magoosh Vocabulary Flashcards.master the first thirteen Magoosh vocab decks (i.e. "Common" and "Basic") using the app. I think there are diminishing returns from learning the seven "advanced" decks; in my opinion, the time and energy to learn 350 more words is better spent doing verbal multiple choice and sentence equivalence practice problems.
</ul>

<li><h3>Phase 2: (Weeks 4-8)</h3>
<h3>Practice tests, practice problems, vocab review, condensed notes. </h3>
<ul>- Continue with Magoosh
</ul>ETS Paper Test 1: 

<ul>- Condensed notes. </ul>
<ul>- ETS Official Guide practice problems (2nd/3rd editions chapters 4 and 6). Do all ten practice sets in the Official Guide. It's important to treat ETS practice problems like gold since they are most representative of the problems that will be on the actual test. For this reason, I chose to save these until after I finished the Magoosh videos and problems, lest I "waste" a perfectly realistic practice problem by attempting it before being familiar with the material. I also completed each set of problems before looking at answers in order to better simulate real test sections where I had to deal with the anxiety of not knowing how well I was doing. For the problems I struggled with and/or got wrong, I watched the associated Magoosh explanation videos.
</ul>
<ul>- Vocab flashcard review. The biggest feature lacking from the Magoosh flashcard app is the ability to reset individual decks for later review. To get around this, I converted the PDF list of words, definitions, and sentences to tab-delimited text files that I practiced in the Flashcards Deluxe iOS app. I really liked this app because I could flag tough words as I reviewed the 13 "common" and "basic" decks to quickly create a single combination deck consisting only of flagged words. The app has a steep learning curve, but the granularity of the feature set is without equal.
</ul>
<ul>- ETS PowerPrep Test 1.
</ul>
<ul>- ETS Quantitative Reasoning Practice Questions. As with the Official Guide practice problems, save these until after Magoosh so as to not waste the 100% real ETS questions when I don't know the topics. These quant questions are definitely harder than most of the Official Guide problems, but they are excellent training for people aiming for high quant scores in the test. I also timed myself during the mixed practice sets at the end to get a sense of when I should skip a problem and come back.
</ul>
<ul>- ETS Verbal Reasoning Practice Questions. Same as above, Save these problems until after Magoosh 
</ul>
<ul>- ETS Paper Test 2.
</ul>
<ul>- Manhattan 5 lb. Book of GRE Practice Problems. In the last week before my test date, I did four or five chapters of quant practice problems from this book in some of my weaker topic areas. The difficulty varies from much easier than the actual test to a bit harder, so keep that in mind. Also, since I was using the first edition I kept an eye on the errata that corrects mistakes in the book.
